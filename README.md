# FPGA Programming 

This repository contains Verilog code developed for programming FPGA boards using **Intel Quartus**. These projects were created as part of my hardware design course and showcase modular design principles and practical digital logic implementations. Key projects include a **Combination Lock** and an **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**.

## Overview

The projects in this repository demonstrate:
- **FPGA Programming Skills**: Hands-on experience with Verilog HDL and FPGA deployment.
- **Modular Code Design**: Each project emphasizes reusable and clean Verilog modules.
- **Practical Applications**: Designs simulate and implement real-world functionality on FPGA boards.

## Projects

### **1. Combination Lock**
A fully functional **combination lock** with robust features:
- **Stores a Combination**: Allows users to set and save a unique combination.
- **Incorrect Attempts Handling**: Triggers an alarm after two incorrect tries.
- **Reset Functionality**: Enables users to set a new combination when needed.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Demonstrates modular Verilog design with well-structured code.
  - Incorporates finite state machines (FSMs) for control logic.

### **2. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)**
A simple **3-bit ALU** designed for FPGA implementation:
- **Addition Operation**: Adds two 3-bit binary numbers.
- **Output Display**: Results are shown on a **7-segment display**.
- **Registers**: Uses registers to store input and output values.
- **Key Highlights**:
  - Demonstrates basic arithmetic operations and display logic.
